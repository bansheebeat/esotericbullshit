# Reading
- **_Death Is Not an Option_ by Suzanne Rivecca.** Finished at last. I have not much new to say compared to last week. I felt a notable sense of relief to be done with it and free to move on.

# Listening
- **_Life's a Riot With Spy vs Spy_, Billy Bragg.** I like "A New England" a whole lot; the rest was good but didn't grab me. There's a sparseness and intimacy that struck me when I first heard "A New England," but the novelty had worn off for the other tracks.
