# Movies
* _Barbie_ - I was underwhelmed. There's been lots of chatter, and I loved _Lady Bird_, but _Barbie_ didn't hit for me; too much Ken (to be the hundredth person to whine about it) and the ending felt unearned and thematically confused. This was more of an homage to _Barbie_ as a product than it was an homage to womanhood, but it pretended to be the latter.

# Games
* _Vampire Survivors_ - I originally played _Vampire Survivors_ for my video game podcast, [Pitch & Play](https://pitchandplay.org) (on hiatus but will come back!); my friend and co-host Ross recommended it to me. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I got into it given that I don't really have nostalgia for this sort of game, but I played several hours of it and then became distracted by life. While moving this month, I was without internet for quite a while and had not hooked up my consoles (or my PC, still). To kill some time while my body recovered from lifting boxes and scrubbing surfaces, I downloaded _Vampire Survivors_ onto my phone and went deep into it. It's a fantastic game that I'll come to associate with my early days in the house.

# Books
* _Walk Two Moons_ by Sharon Creech - I read this book originally as a child in the fifth grade. I remember loving it but little else. I have been looking for a text to add to my curriculum and wanted to try _Walk Two Moons_ out. I enjoyed reading it and was surprised by how much of it came back to me even though I am (nearly) twenty years out from reading it the first time. I do think the Native American set dressing might be problematic given that the author is not, by any account I've read, actually Native; the plot is also predictable, but perhaps that is because I'm an adult reading a book written for children and because I've read it before. I'm not sure it's the book I'm looking for, but it's not a bad read.
