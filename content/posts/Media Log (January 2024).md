# TV
* **_One Tree Hill_, season six and seven** - I've been marathoning One Tree Hill on a friend's recommendation. By this season, we are well passed the "good" seasons, but it's still entertaining enough to watch â€” if only to count how many more car crashes the writers will introduce as plot lines. I think the early (1-4) seasons are a decent watch, but at this point, I'm really just seeing it through to the end. Season seven has a novelty in seeing how a show pivots after losing its main character. I don't think _OTH_ did so gracefully; they elevated some, generously, background characters into the main act and lumped on bunch of new ones at that. Some work better than others, but at least I'm almost at the end.
* **_Kitchen Nightmares_ (2023)** - Years ago, I once came home to find my partner watching _Kitchen Nightmares_ on YouTube. He's generally not a fan of reality or competition shows, so I asked him why he was watching it. He giggled and said, "He [Gordon] just gets so mad." That led to me also watching a bunch of the show. This month I watched a gabi belle video in which she talked about the reboot, so I dipped in too. Gordon does indeed still get mad. When watching _Kitchen Nightmares_, I am always thinking of how much fun the show must be to edit. The editors make liberal use of the most unhinged sound effects imaginable. It's junk food TV, and who doesn't love junk food?
* **Schitt's Creek** - I've been casually rewatching as my background noise / take a nap on the couch TV. Still hilarious and as good as the first time.
* **The Bachelor** - Two of my friends are big fans, so I'm watching the current season with them. I've never seen any _Bachelor_ properties before this; I'm mostly along for the ride. The show has yet to hit the reality TV highs that keep me looped in to shows like _America's Next Top Model_ or _Survivor_, and the whole concept still feels quite skeezy to me.
# Music
* **_III_, The Lumineers** - I have liked some of The Lumineers' hits for years, but a friend really loves them, so I thought I'd give _III_ a shot. I understand it's a concept album with stories and characters; I really haven't delved into that. I'm unsure if that's because I haven't found it compelling or because I am trying to focus more on the _sound_ rather than just the words (I've always been more for the latter). _III_ sounds great; it reminds me of how much I love the piano. It's the focal point of many songs on the album but also beautifully interspersed as a twinkly highlight or backdrop. Particular favorites are "Donna" and "My Cell."

* [**_another summer_ (Nightcore Edition)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KOpAnAMMA), **neverknowsbest** - I didnt know what nightcore was until now. neverknowsbest is a friend's project and I really liked their debut album, so I gave this a shot. I can't say I really "get" nightcore, but I'm constantly impressed by how talented my friends are.

* **_Modal Soul_, Nujabes** - I've listened to a lot of Nujabes-adjacent and inspired acts for years now (Tycho, emancipator, aether, Little People, etc.) but never the man himself. _Modal Soul_ had some good moments (I love "Feather"), but it was mostly background noise that bordered on repetitive. Disappointed, but I'll try more Nujabes eventually.

* **_Never Hungover Again_, Joyce Manor** - I love this album. It's simple and to the point; no song overstays its welcome. Each track exists just long enough to get a catchy tune through your ears then exits gracefully. I absolutely love "Heart Tattoo" in particular, to the point where I'm actually considering getting one (maybe, sort of, not really, but also I might just).

* **_Best Buds_, Mom Jeans** - I had high hopes for this group based on the band name and that they are often mentioned in the same breath as Joyce Manor. _Best Buds_ was a disappointment; the only song I found somewhat tolerable was "Edward 40hands," but the rest is plagued by cloyingly nasal vocals that drag down some pleasant guitar licks.

# Movies
* **_Fast X_** - an enjoyable entry in the _Fast_ series, and I can officially say that I'm caught up (aside from _Hobbes & Shaw_; maybe that will feature later on this list). It's by far not the best _Fast_ movie (I think that's still _Fast Five_), and I don't really care for Jason Momoa as a villain. There's something tired and a little problematic about the "wacky sociopath" trope, but the flair for drama and action is alive and well in this film. It's definitely the best of the post-7 films, but I can see how some might be turned off by the copious fan service and many celebrity cameos. Personally, I come to these films for cheap thrills and excess; I know what I'm in for and don't begrudge them for indulging that.

* **_Saltburn_** - a friend has been obsessed with this film and we finally sat down to watch it. It was horrifying (in a good way) and beautifully shot (even if I don't love the choice to put it in 4:3). I don't often like the movies I watch (the ones that aren't _Fast_ movies I guess); I hesitate to say that I _liked_ this one so much as found it interesting and enjoyable. I don't think I'd watch it again or recommend it to others. I appreciate that it was coherent and accessible in its themes compared to something like _The Lighthouse_ (which I hated)[^1] which often feels like it is showing you weird shit just to show you weird shit. _Saltburn_ knows the themes it wants to explore and presents then well to the audience. Barry looks way too old, though.

* **_My Big Fat Greek Wedding_** and **_Crazy Rich Asians_** - Watched is a generous term; this was more "talked through at a friend's house." I'd seen the former several times already and have some affection for it. I'd not seen _Crazy Rich Asians_ before; it didn't really capture my interest, but then, I didn't really try either.

[^1]: The only thing _Saltburn_ and _The Lighthouse_ have in common is prominently featuring a jerk off scene, I think.
