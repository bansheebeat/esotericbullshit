# Reading
- **_Death Is Not an Option_ by Suzanne Rivecca.** Finished at last. I have not much new to say compared to last week. I felt a notable sense of relief to be done with it and free to move on.

# Watching
- **_America's Next Top Model_, cycle three.** _Top Model_ is my comfort show right now. I love the first seven cycles best, but cycle three has a special place in my heart. It's one of the first cycles I ever saw and has one of the most entertaining casts. The modelling itself is pretty poor, but that's not really what _Top Model_ was about.

# Listening
- **_Life's a Riot With Spy vs Spy_, Billy Bragg.** I like "A New England" a whole lot; the rest was good but didn't grab me. There's a sparseness and intimacy that struck me when I first heard "A New England," but the novelty had worn off for the other tracks.
- **_For Emma, Forever Ago_, Bon Iver.** I listened to this all the way through one night and it unfortunately really spoke to me. I know I've listened through it before, years ago, and I didn't care for anything except "Skinny Love"; this time around, every track hit.
- **"Bishop, CA"** and **The Wig Master, Xiu Xiu.** I swore off Xiu Xiu back in 2013 or so after listening to them heavily during a deep depression; I'm not cold turkey on them anymore, but they're not in my regular rotation either. I've been thinking of these two a lot lately. They were two of my favorites back then.
