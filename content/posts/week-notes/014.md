first week notes in a while so some of this might not be strictly "this week"

# Doing
* I turned 30. I had a big party with lots of friends â€” and I feel grateful to have so many folks who want to celebrate with me, including some who drove substantial distances. I still have a bunch of mixed up feelings about crossing this threshold, but I'm trying to remember the advice of a friend: it's a gift to grow older
* This maybe belongs under a playing heading, but maybe not: I picked up **_Ring Fit Adventure_** for the first time since the pandemic. It's getting to be too cold out to run, so I need an alternate fitness option. My most reliable gym buddy moved away, so I'm seeing if I can get _Ring Fit_ to stick again. I am definitely in way better shape than when I was playing years ago; I would feel faint after 20-30 minutes in the game, but my first session was over 30 minutes and I felt fine (albeit sweaty) after. Turning 30 feels like an inflection point where I need to get serious about losing weight.
# Listening
* **Rainbow Kitten Surprise, _RKS_.** Listened on the recommendation of a friend; I was concerned initially because I really didn't like the first track (my words: "Big garage vibes. Like shit you listen to while you work on your motorcycle"), but after that hump, I really enjoyed the album.
