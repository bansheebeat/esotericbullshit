first week notes in a while so some of this might not be strictly "this week"

# Doing
* I turned 30. I had a big party with lots of friends â€” and I feel grateful to have so many folks who want to celebrate with me, including some who drove substantial distances. I still have a bunch of mixed up feelings about crossing this threshold, but I'm trying to remember the advice of a friend: it's a gift to grow older
# Listening
* **Rainbow Kitten Surprise, _RKS_.** Listened on the recommendation of a friend; I was concerned initially because I really didn't like the first track (my words: "Big garage vibes. Like shit you listen to while you work on your motorcycle"), but after that hump, I really enjoyed the album.
