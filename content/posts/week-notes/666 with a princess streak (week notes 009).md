# Reading
* **_No One Belongs Here More than You_, Miranda July.** This has been in my Amazon wishlist for I don't know how long â€” long enough that I've forgotten where I'd found it or why I'd wanted to read it. I liked the cover a lot, I guess. Anyway, I feel this is suffering from my reading it so soon after _Death Is Not an Option_ as I have much of the same opinion: excellent prose but turned off by all the weird sex.[^1] I find July's narrators and conceits to be far more varied than Rivecca's, but Rivecca never made me read about an old man who fantasizes about teenage girls, so I automatically like her better.

# Listening
* **_i,i_, Bon Iver.** Not bad, but I like _For Emma_ and _22, A Million_ far more.

[^1]: reading these books back to back has left me wondering if I'm somehow selecting books only written by deviants
