# Doing
* Working on getting off big corporate social media, still. I'm almost entirely off Twitter; I keep the app just because I have a few notifications set for when specific people tweet (mostly bands who tweet out tour dates), but I'm otherwise mostly on Mastodon (social.lol) and Discord. Cohost going down was sad to see even if I was never an active user, but it impressed on me even further the importance of owning your content — and it made me really happy to have this space for my thoughts and writing.

# Reading
* **_No One Belongs Here More than You_, Miranda July.** This has been in my Amazon wishlist for I don't know how long — long enough that I've forgotten where I'd found it or why I'd wanted to read it. I liked the cover a lot, I guess. Anyway, I feel this is suffering from my reading it so soon after _Death Is Not an Option_ as I have much of the same opinion: excellent prose but turned off by all the weird sex.[^1] I find July's narrators and conceits to be far more varied than Rivecca's, but Rivecca never made me read about an old man who fantasizes about teenage girls, so I automatically like her better.

# Listening
* **_i,i_, Bon Iver.** Not bad, but I like _For Emma_ and _22, A Million_ far more.

[^1]: reading these books back to back has left me wondering if I'm somehow selecting books only written by deviants
