# Doing
* My volleyball rec league started back up! I'm awful and uncoordinated on the court, but it's fun to play with friends, and I have learned the hard way that exercise helps to stave off the depression.
# Reading
* **_No One Belongs Here More than You,_ Miranda July.** I stand by what I said last week. I think I need a break from the sexual deviants I'm apparently (and unconsciously) selecting lately.
# Listening
* **_Green Dream in F#_, The Bug Club.** I asked a student of mine what kind of music she listened to; she said her music was too weird and I'd probably never heard of it. I took that as a personal challenge. I liked it! It does remind me of something I can't quite place.[^1] But it's not that weird â€” although, as an (ex?) Xiu Xiu listener, my barometer is off.
[^1]: I think it's Times New Viking.
