# Listening
* **Charli XCX, _Brat and it's completely different but also still brat_.** Every re-release and new drop for _brat_ innovates, co-exists, and complements. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a statement of how pivotal the album has been personally and for the industry writ large. This version of "Everything is romantic" is as much a remix as an iteration; the original captures a single moment in beautiful, mimetic detail, and this one is another artist following the theme and form with their own experiences. _brat_ is undoubtedly a project we'll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing its creation in real time.
	* For the haters, a friend of mine said the mixing was bad and that it "just sounds like noise." I still like her.
* **Foxholes, _Foxholes_.** I found "Alligator" while going through Daytrotter archives and really enjoyed it; the rest of the album is pleasant listening, but "Alligator" is really the stand out.
