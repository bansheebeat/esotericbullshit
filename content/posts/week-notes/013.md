# Doing
* I presented to pre-service teachers at my alma mater with a colleague! Emotionally, I still feel like I was in their spot not that long ago — and then I remember I graduated over six years ago (and into a vastly different world and job market).
* I'm finding myself using ellipses a lot and I do not like it. Is this growing old? Am I becoming a boomer?
* I'm thinking about maintaining some kind of daily log — just simple, passing notes on what I did, what I thought about. Obsidian has this feature built in and it might be a good way to start. I like the idea of it being searchable and (theoretically) infinite in size, but I also want an excuse for another notebook.
	* I used to do daily reflections at the end of my work day. Slowly, those became every few days, then every week, then rarely. It was a good practice that I wish I had maintained, but there's already so much I'm packing into my work day — and my goal in daily notes is to be more mindful about what I'm doing and thinking in my free time.
* I attended my state-wide English teacher conference; this is something like my sixth or seventh time attending and I still find it valuable. I left with a lot of great ideas on how to diversify my practice and better empower my students.
# Listening
* **Charli XCX, _Brat and it's completely different but also still brat_.** Every re-release and new drop for _brat_ innovates, co-exists, and complements. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a statement of how pivotal the album has been personally and for the industry writ large. This version of "Everything is romantic" is as much a remix as an iteration; the original captures a single moment in beautiful, mimetic detail, and this one is another artist following the theme and form with their own experiences. _brat_ is undoubtedly a project we'll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing its creation in real time.
	* For the haters, a friend of mine said the mixing was bad and that it "just sounds like noise." I still like her (Charli and the friend, in that order[^1]).
* **Foxholes, _Foxholes_.** I found "Alligator" while going through Daytrotter archives and loved it; the rest of the album is pleasant listening, but "Alligator" is the stand out.
* **Yung Lean, _Stardust_.** I loved Yung Lean's feature on _Brat and it's completely different but also still brat_; imagine my surprise when I discovered that [the esoteric bullshit (or so I thought) I was listening to ten+ years ago as a joke but not really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgrSjynPKs&pp=ygUJeXVuZyBsZWFu) went on to be a critically recognized artist. I thought it was just a weird fucking song. 
	* _Stardust_ is a much more polished and, dare I say, coherent and digestible[^2] product than "Hurt"; I like it, but I'm not sure any of the songs will earn the coveted ⭐ on Plex.[^3] It's music I'd have to be in a mood for — although the mumble-y nature of it makes it good background music while working. Maybe it just needs to sit with me a little more.
[^1]: just kidding :-)
[^2]: but the contrary is maybe more fun
[^3]: maybe I should do a write up on how I organize my ridiculous music collection (18191 tracks and growing every day)
