# Listening
* **Charli XCX, _Brat and it's completely different but also still brat_.** The _brat_ project honestly goes so hard; every re-release and new drop innovates on something already incredible, co-existing and complimenting. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a demarcation of how pivotal the album has been for the industry writ large. This is undoubtedly an album we'll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing it in real time.
