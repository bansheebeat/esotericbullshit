# Listening
* **Charli XCX, _Brat and it's completely different but also still brat_.** The _brat_ project honestly goes so hard; every re-release and new drop innovates on something already incredible, co-existing and complimenting. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a demarcation of how pivotal the album has been for the industry writ large as well as on a personal level: this version of "Everything is romantic" is as much a remix as an iteration; the original captures a single moment in beautiful detail, and this one is another artist following the theme and form with their own experiences. _brat_ is undoubtedly a project we'll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing its creation in real time.
