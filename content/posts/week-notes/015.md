# Playing
* **_Satisfactory._** Just a few months before the pandemic, while I was in grad school, I fell deeply in love with _Satisfactory_ and attempted to explain in vain to my literary and well-rounded colleagues that my free time was consumed by balancing my iron production pipelines and converting from biomass energy to coal. I dipped my toe in a few more times after my mania but resolved to wait until 1.0 as many of my production lines would need to be seriously re-tooled. Joe suggested we dive in with a co-op save and I am back and thriving.

# Reading
* **_Into the Wild_ by John Krakauer.** As a kid, the film adaptation was on frequent rotation in my house; my mom often fixated on one movie and watched it over and over, and she was a big fan of the soundtrack as well. I've always wanted to read the book since, and I'm trying again to commit to reading more now that the start of school year frenzy has died down for me. I'm enjoying following McCandless's story and don't think Krakauer too effusive (though his biases are clear), but some of the tangents feel extraneous.
