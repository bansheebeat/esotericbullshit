* Circles - love
* Complicated - the synths in this song are so bad, and the pitched up ab libs are awful. It feels like if someone else tried to make a Mac song and imitate the Delusional Thomas features.
* Blue World - like it more than I remember but it is a little grating
* Good News - good; loved it when I first heard it but it's gotten a little stale
