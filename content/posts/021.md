* Circles - love
* Complicated - the synths in this song are so bad, and the pitched up ab libs are awful. It feels like if someone else tried to make a Mac song and imitate the Delusional Thomas features.
* Blue World - like it more than I remember but it is a little grating
* Good News - good; loved it when I first heard it but it's gotten a little stale
* I Can See - again, the synths! They're awful. They sound like a jrpg hotel track and not in a good way.
* Everybody - another I like more than I recall. I like hearing Mac sing, but there's something very stale in the instrumentation and production. It's a refined but dry track.
