title: "When Annie calls and I hear her voice on the phone I know she cares and I never felt that way before / as if I ever deserved something so serene in my life, should it really be so surreal?"

Take it back, take it back, take it back all the way / I never thought that I’d be so thoughtless / waking up all alone on your cold pissed stained floor, now I know that it’s something I don’t want anymore / When Annie calls and I hear her voice on the phone I know she cares and I never felt that way before / as if I ever deserved something so serene in my life, should it really be so surreal?  

I miss the way that I felt back when I was 17, back then you could break my heart and I wouldn’t feel a thing, don’t miss the way that I lived back when I was 24, and I’ll never feel unimportant anymore

Later on, later on, later on in the night my spirals form and I know that I will not sleep tonight / I’ll take a walk and I’ll stand on Schenley Park pool, my prince has come and I know that it isn’t you / on Easter Day I will say exactly how that I feel, her parents gone oh I’m shaking and it doesn’t feel real / if you should ever leave me oh I don’t know what I would do, what good would living do me if I can’t spend my life with you?

Days are gone when I can’t get out of bed and I’m praying to a god and I’m wishing I was dead / Don’t miss the way that felt all those many years before and I’ll never feel unimportant anymore

Don’t think that I could ever / Just leave it all up to fate / and now I know I’ll never / Won’t ever act like that again, because now I know just who I am / Now I know exactly who I want to be / Now I know exactly want I want / Now I know exactly what I want and I know that it’s you

[interlude lyrics taken from “Lean on Me” written by Bill Withers (1972)]
Sometimes in our live, we all have pain we all have sorrow oh but I know if we are wise then we will know there’s always tomorrow / if there is a load you have to bear that you can’t carry I’m up the road, I’ll share your load, oh but you know you gotta just call me
