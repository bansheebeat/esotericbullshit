# Doing
I **bought a new domain name** — I'm not going to post it just yet — but I'm considering switching this site over to it. I love esotericbullshit, but I'm not sure it's the energy I want to put out there. It makes the URL a little hard to share. But it also feels remarkably stupid when I _just_ moved this over from another domain (which is incidentally quite similar to the new one...).[^1]

# Reading
I'm continuing to read **_Woman Hollering Creek and other stories_** by Sandra Cisneros (from last week). I really loved "Never Marry a Mexican"; many of the early stories are told from the perspective of a child or a teen. Cisneros excels here (see _Mango Street_), but it becomes a little exhausting; "Never Marry" was a welcome break. Some of the stories run long, though, and can begin to feel repetitive — but then, I don't think you're meant to marathon through this but rather read stories here and there from the collection.

[^1]: Here's the thing: I already bought the new one, so I should just do what I want and chase whatever feels natural and authentic to me in this moment. But I *do* also think it's important to maintain some sense of permanency, as I don't want this to be just another web project that I abandon. I admire the folks who have been blogging at the same site for a decade (even more so if they've left all that legacy content up); I tend to grow self-conscious a year or more on and delete, forget, abandon. So why not commit to the choice I've made — even if it doesn't feel right _now_, maybe it will tomorrow? Or should I chase what inspires and just set up redirects...? Discuss. (By which I mean send me an email if you've ever been caught in this conundrum; like Fleabag, I think I just want someone to tell me what to do, right now and in general.)
