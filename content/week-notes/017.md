# Doing
I **bought a new domain name** — I'm not going to post it just yet — but I'm considering switching this site over to it. I love esotericbullshit, but I'm not sure it's the energy I want to put out there. It makes the URL a little hard to share. But it also feels remarkably stupid when I _just_ moved this over from another domain (which is incidentally quite similar to the new one...).[^1]

[^1]: Here's the thing: I already bought the new one, so I should just do what I want and chase what it is that feels natural and authentic. But I *do* also think it's important to maintain some sense of permanency as I don't want this to be just another web project that I abandon. But I can also just set up redirects...
