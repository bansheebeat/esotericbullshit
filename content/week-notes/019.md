# Watching
I've burned through several seasons of **_Girls_** since my last week notes. I'm in the last season now, and my opinions have started to solidify. I think if I'd watch the show at the time of airing, I'd have found Lena et al. insufferably pretentious.

# Playing
Joe and I have been playing lots of **_Satisfactory_**. We've reached Tier 6 but are focused on redoing / optimizing old supply lines and completing the FICSMAS event before we get into oil production.
