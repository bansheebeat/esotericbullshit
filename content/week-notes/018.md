# Doing
Unfortunately I haven't been able to exercise much; partly, this is because I haven't been making the time for it, but I also tweaked my right shoulder somehow and it's been quite painful to use in every day tasks. _Ring Fit_ is therefore off the table. The trouble is that I genuinely don't know what I did to it!
