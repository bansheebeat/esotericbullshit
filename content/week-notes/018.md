# Doing
Unfortunately I haven't been able to exercise much; partly, this is because I haven't been making the time for it, but I also tweaked my right shoulder somehow and it's been quite painful to use in every day tasks. _Ring Fit_ is therefore off the table. The trouble is that I genuinely don't know what I did to it!

I briefly contemplated [spending far too much money on a print of Martha Rich's "Stop Talking,"](https://20x200.com/products/stop-talking?variant=10674962884) but I'm far too poor and cheap, even though it expertly captures how I feel lately after work (or  interacting with anyone).

# Reading
I'm still (re-)reading _Pride & Prejudice_.

# Watching
Joe and I finished the **_Emma_** mini-series that we started last week; I'd seen it before and found it similarly delightful this time around, though I'm beginning to doubt my prior assertions that _Emma_ is Austen's work (albeit not my personal favorite). Perhaps a re-read is in order...
