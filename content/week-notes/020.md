# Watching
To close out my viewing of **_Girls_**, I watched [Princess Weekes's thoughtful and well-rounded analysis of it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sQY0F_ioh6Q). I generally agree with a lot of what she's said. I think the racial politics of the show suck, and while I think Lena is somewhat correct in her defense that she wrote from her own experience and would not perhaps be able to authentically write characters of color, that all could easily have been solved by just having a more diverse writing staff. Lena deserves much of the flack she gets, but I also think Weekes is correct that that ire should also be directed to the studio execs who do not prioritize diversity â€” as **_Girls_** is far from the only show to have had this problem (even though it became the lightning rod for it, for both good and bad faith reasons).
