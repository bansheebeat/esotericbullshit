# Doing

# Reading

# Watching

# Playing
I started up *Final Fantasy XIV* again and finally reached First Serpent Lieutenant in my Grand Company, which means I'll now be able to use my seals to get more mounts.

# Listening
I listened to selections from *Cerulean* and all of *Obsidian* by Baths, both albums I've loved at points in my life; *Guts* is out and I wanted to refresh before listening to it.
