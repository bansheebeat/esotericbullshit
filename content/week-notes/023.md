# Watching
I finished *Euphoria*. I think I really liked it? Season two went some bad (as in, poorly written and plotted) places, but so did season one I think â€” the first season was just a lot tighter and more cohesive. I've read some about the behind the scenes drama with the show, which sours me a bit. But even though Jules's character takes a turn in season two, I still love her. I don't see the turn as horrifically out of character or frustrating as some others do
