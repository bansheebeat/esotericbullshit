# Doing
We had an unexpected snow day on Tuesday and then Wednesday off for Lunar New Year, which was a welcomed opportunity to relax at home. I played a lot of **_Fields of Mistria_** and did some upgrades to the computers in my house — all three (my PC, Joe's, and one hooked up to our TV) are AM4 builds, so I'm able to upgrade my PC and put the old parts into the others.

Joe and I had a talk about something I've been rolling around in my head a lot lately — my inability to shut my brain off and enjoy things, my refusal to ever just commit to the moment. It's maybe a topic for a longer post.

# Reading

# Watching
I finished *Euphoria*. I think I really liked it? Season two went some bad (as in, poorly written and plotted) places, but so did season one I think — the first season was just a lot tighter and more cohesive. I've read some about the behind the scenes drama with the show, which sours me — the creator seems like a dick. Jules remains my favorite, and I'm interested to see where season three goes if it ever actually gets made.

# Playing

# Listening
I listened to *10000 gecs* after really liking *1000 gecs*. It was a disappointment personally; I admire experimentation and innovation, but it didn't hit for me. It strayed too far from the goofy hyperpop that they did so well on *1000 gecs*; it was too much of a genre mishmash that leaned too hard into absurdism for the sake of comedy.
