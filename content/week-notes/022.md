# Doing
I'm struggling this week again of course — the seasonal depression, the news, and it was my dad's birthday, who I recently and somewhat unwittingly went zero contact with. I'm thankful right now for the friends I have around me.

# Reading
On Sunday, ashamed of having yet another week note with **_Pride & Prejudice_** still in progress, I finally sat (laid) down and finished off the last twenty pages. I love the book just as much (maybe more? is this recency bias speaking?) as I did years ago and feel once again confident calling it one of my favorite books.
# Watching
I'm continuing on with **_Euphoria_**, but I'm still undecided on it. Maybe I was a loser in high school[^1], but these plotlines seem absurd (and gross and exploitative) for sixteen year olds. I also think some of the characters' motivations and actions — particularly Nate — make absolutely no sense. In general there's really just too many characters that we're splitting our time between. Rue and Jules are the highlight of the show for me. I also really don't love that an episode used "Shook Ones Pt. II" as a title but then didn't play the song at all during the episode. Regardless, I've finished the first season and will probably give the second a try.
# Playing
I bought **_Fields of Mistria_** and have been playing that. Joe and I have kept up with Mistria Mondays on [Friends at the Table](https://www.youtube.com/c/FriendsattheTable), and he started playing it a few weeks ago. I'm still very early on in it. I like it, but it has yet to fill me with the same joy and wonder that **_Stardew Valley_** did. I do think it's a little unfair that it is constantly compared to _Stardew_ — it should be allowed to exist and be discussed on its own merits, and _Stardew_ is far from the first to do a lot of what it does — but the comparison is sort of inevitable. _Stardew_ saw me through a pretty intense period of depression years ago, so I think I sought out _Mistria_ for the same reasons.[^2]
# Listening

[^1]: I know I was, but if being *not* a loser means being involved in the shit these kids get into, then I'm glad to be a loser.
[^2]: I would not say I am intensely depressed right now, but seasonal depression is real and I probably have it and also Trump is president again so who isn't?
