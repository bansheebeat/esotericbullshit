# Doing
* I went for a run with a good friend at an indoor track near me. The track itself is quite short, so the run is a little awkward, but it's a super soft flooring which made the run easy on my joints. It's nice to have a new run buddy, too!
# Reading
* [Hometown Visit](https://lanadelrue.bearblog.dev/hometown-visit)
* **Sandra Cisneros, _Woman Hollering Creek_.** I'm waiting for _Villette_ to come in, so I wanted something that would be easy to jump in and out of. This fits the bill; I love _Mango Street_ dearly and this simply feels like more of it (albeit not following one character, but then, Cisneros's stories all seem to co-exist).
* [25 Wirecutter Journalists Canâ€™t Be Wrong: How Owala Became an Official Water Bottle Pick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/owala-freesip-review/). What a ridiculously self-important, self-absorbed article. I generally like and use Wirecutter; some of their recommendations are ridiculously decadent and detached from reality, but they are one of the few reliable online sources for product reviews and recommendations. I am all for an ode to something you love and that makes your life better, but this read not as "we tested and compared a lot of products" but more "we all have good taste and have this water bottle so it must be good, right?"
# Playing
* **_Pride & Prejudice The Board Game_**. My brother gifted this to me years ago and I've never found an opportunity to play it. A student of mine is listening to the audiobook of _P&P_ on my recommendation and I told her about the board game; I thought I should play it first myself, so I convinced Joe to play with me.
