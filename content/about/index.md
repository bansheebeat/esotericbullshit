hi, my name is cassie.

I'm an English teacher from New York. esoteric bullshit is my online home; right now, it's mostly a blog and repository for week notes, a catalogue of the things I'm doing and consuming every week.

this site is currently built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I edit my posts in Obsidian (with the help of [GitSync](https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync) on mobile) and sync them to a [github repo](https://github.com/bansheebeat/esotericbullshit), which builds and deploys my site. I built the theme myself and tweak it almost constantly.
